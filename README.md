# Keyboard Paint

A very simple paint program where you press a key and move the mouse to draw lines.

Features: Drawing

Planned features: Clear canvas, ability to change color and line thickness

I made this program so I could make passable math sketches on a school laptop, so not adding anything else besides that.
